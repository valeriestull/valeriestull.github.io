I am an interdisciplinary environmental scientist and global health professional with
12 years of experience and a successful track record of
applied research, project management, fundraising, and
outreach. I am passionate about the overlap between agriculture, climate change, and human health.

My focal areas are international development, planetary health,
research impact, non-profit efficacy, and cross-cultural partnership.  During my PhD, I
focused on edible insects as a climate-friendly and sustainable source
of low-cost protein.  Through my career, I have developed a toolkit including:

  
- Successful project leadership, raising over $350,000 in
  research funding, personally hiring and managing nine research team
  members, and running a multi-institution clinical trial

- Strong research capabilities including applied field research,
  health impact assessment, clinical trials, survey development and
  enumeration, quantitative and qualitative statistical methods, and
  policy assessment
  
- Effective and persuasive communication skills with an extensive written
  and verbal presentaiton portfolio - we need to spread the message;
  doing the research alone isn't enough!
  
- Passion for sustainably improving human and environmental health
  among low-resource communities by optimizing co-benefits across the
  agriculture – environment – human health nexus 
  
- Expertise in holistic global health, food security, food
  sovereignty, climate-smart and nutrition sensitive agriculture,
  maternal health, gender, and edible insect agriculture
  
- Ability to work with with stakeholders and institutions across government, academia, and the private sector
  
- Field experience: Kenya, Rwanda, Zambia, South Africa, Ethiopia,
  India, Palestine, and Peru
