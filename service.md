### [Kidlinks World](https://www.kidlinksworld.org/)
<i>Board Member & Volunteer</i>   

Kidlinks World is a non-profit operating in Madison, Wisconsin and
Johannesburg, South Africa. Kidlinks empowers vulnerable children and
youth through education, caregiving, and skills training by directly
connecting donors with grassroots initiatives.

I provide administrative and organizational support for fundraising, project planning,
organization, and outreach - and coordinate field-projects for US volunteers and students.

### [The LAND Project](https://thelandproject.org/)
<i>Leadership Team Member</i>   

Improving health, tackling economic challenges, and managing natural
resources are all important aspects of agroecological development that
are tightly interlinked. The Livelihood, Agroecology, Nutrition, and
Development (LAND) Project is committed to addressing these challenges
using a holistic, participatory approach to agroecological
developmentâ€”one where the most up-to-date scientific evidence is
merged with crucial, on the ground know-how and contextual knowledge.

I have led volunteer groups to Johannesburg and the Eastern Cape many
times for the LAND project, and help coordinate fundraising,
stakeholder engagement, and outreach.
