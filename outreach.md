If you're interested in applied impact, communicating research is
nearly as important as the quality of the research itself. I do my
best to invest time and energy to succinctly and engagingly share my
research as best as I am able, and enjoy building connections and
conversations on the issues I tackle in my work.

If you like, [click
here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy2ZbuElGPA&t=5h32m40s) for a
short flash talk at the Stanford Planetary Health conference in 2019,
or [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icVet6WJIWY) for a
general interest lecture describing some of the environmental and
societal benefits of consuming insects, particularly in developing
country contexts.
