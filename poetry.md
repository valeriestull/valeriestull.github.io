*It took bravery to click on my poetry tab.  But you did it, you're here.  Poetry is the way I understand the world.  It is the perfect complement to my life as a scientist and gives breath to what truly has meaning.  I write modern poetry in a variety of forms and covering topics from insects to the anthropocene to feminism.  I'd love to share more with you if ever you are interested.  For now, I'll let you enjoy this long-form poem from a few years ago.*

Theory of Everything
by v.stull 

Close your mouth. A body you know is re-teaching you
to breathe. Let me sound out the alphabet 
with my own tongue. Press your palm to my chest, while
I trace the shadows on your back. *Winter leaves us still
wanting*.  Imagine my elbow resting  
on the piano, my eyes damp, the smell of apples  
on my neck in the dusty light.  I am humming  
that song we both know.  The one always off-key and
awkward.  I am sketching the moon  
on the dining room table.  *A place for gathering*. When
we were young we made patchwork mazes with
fishhooks and rusty cans.  We navigated on crooked toes.
We can find the door this key opens.  Our minds are weak
enough to melt, to admit things.  *I’m as drunk as your
father at his retirement party.  And you are petting me
with calloused thumbs*.  
I bristle when you stroke my hair. Stroke my hair.  
It isn’t that the sun can’t creep between our blinds, it’s that we don’t recognize the light for what it is. We like our mysteries slightly underdone so as not 
to awake angry beasts.  The inner worlds of panic taste like soap.  
You are anything but pragmatic.  Give me your productivity for moments of reality.  In the summer you painted houses the color of New Mexico and sandstone. We made a garden 
with punctured tires.  Planted the perfect things inside: peppers, squash, turnips. Planted real seeds between the black rubber and red dirt. Water them with all your strength.  Is it too much to hope
that what we plant takes root?  Are roots enough 
to outstand the wind? I go to sleep in the same bed and wake in the same room. This is where I exist.  You are a spackled bedframe of bone and flesh. You creak when we creak and sigh when we sigh.  
Let the names of the others escape from lips.  Let the darkness saunter through mirrors in maroon strips and leather bandages. Your mahogany basement.  You, a young hearted lover, my infinite adjustment.  We are the questions.  We are unsteady answers.  Which is of course why everything we need to know is hidden in books. Stories of epic heroes 
and murderous battles.  A princess longs from 
her tower as the history of the world is made in clockwork and festering. It’s our imagination.
Her hair the color of willow bark and gown 
an amethyst curtain. Stories we know without believing. 
Of course you grow a bonsai so small 
it can fit inside my mouth.  It is an attempt to finish something.  Until death or until we learn how to write our names in water.  Four drops for every candle.  Give it small leaves and tender care and ice cubes of water. This is the opposite of igniting.  We have not yet covered the horizon with trail marks nor tire treads. We have not. You call it the Theory of Everything. But I say, We are disintegrating.  Imagine the cat under the dining room table pressing its nose to your shin.  Imagine me in a robe stirring kitchen things with a long wooden spoon.  You say, The largest part of me is yours for the taking. I know of course, the way your fingers collect splinters.  All I have to give I want to give to you.
We laugh at the weight of all the bullshit in the world and how it weighs less than you mean.  You mean everything
you say. To me, to me, with rain on slanted panes and windshields.  Push your back into the fireplace until the skin turns pink.  That is the temperature of my ideology.  As children, again, we were popsicle days and learning to run.  Up mountains down canyons at the speed of youth. In the afternoon I will find the skeleton of an aged elk on the back ridge.  Feathery tendons will still be draped over bones, where teeth marks gnaw.  If you were here, you’d touch it with a stick and we would count the vertebra. We’d make up a story about the end. We’d follow the patterns of bones back down to the valley.  A body is only as strong as its bones. What remains are the histories unspoken. Remember the time 
I put my head on your shoulder and we turned pinball into a sex game.  We took blue chalk, drew lines down the centers of rooms in our houses.
Right meant eat. Left meant sleep.  The arrows pointed to windows.  We were not afraid to drink
the glass.
Take me to the top of the world. I promise not to give anyone the directions.  
I promise to tell you when I lie. If every freckle were an island, you would be the next discovered galaxy.  Your ocean as blue as my mother’s iris garden, your stars like salt droplets. We each have these histories, the one’s we’re ashamed of. They build up like magazines in the corner of the closet.  Because it used to be like this.  Because we loved those others with the same real hearts that empty our veins on every hour. We know the ending to the story. We are proud of the plot.  But someone knows the true beginning. The place where the alphabet was formed inside splitting cells. Use your fork and press it through the mandarin orange until it hits the bottom can ever so slightly. Yes, that sound, that pressure.  That’s all you need.  Peel the dry skin from your heel and place it in geometric shapes on the table.  Wait for your breath to move them. Yes, that breath. That’s all you need. We are sorry, too, and honestly.  
My real-pseudo-life.  Our mutual friends.  We’re too busy and tired all the time.  We’re a smashed lotus
before and after. Picture a broken bridge with all the fracture wood.  And people crawling 
through streams.  We are an empty street in Rome. Just air. I like that no one knows me here. Anonymous inside a box of names.  On paper scraps and take away lids. And you’ll say 
I don't want to be alone in this world.  But I know I have to be.  You say the truest things, and together we fuse ideas and melt green glass.  We shape crystals with our elbows.  Sometimes I cry because it is raining and you are resting there on the left chest spot where we last spoke outside the rundown burrito shop on Main.  Crying because we could not figuresolve a way out. Glue is sometimes water soluble and beneath the tears and crushed leaves, we are children once more.  Remember the brush of my hand in sticky evening summer after running along the shore. We find sap in our hair after climbing 
the memory sour. Climb to numbness. We always curl like Ss on carpet. 
I’m used to this now the deepest 
feeling. I hide in between my real life and my other real life. I exist in the gap-space occupied by your guitar.  This is where. Let the rain be just rain and your face the Nile River. Bury old letters when they start to. Hold my fists with your tongue. Everything is.  The ancients can still hear us breathing.
