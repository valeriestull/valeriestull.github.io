*It took bravery to click on my poetry tab.  But you did it, you're here!  Poetry is the way I understand the world.  It is the perfect complement to my life as a scientist and gives breath to what truly has meaning.  I write modern poetry in a variety of forms and covering topics from insects to the anthropocene to feminism.  I'd love to share more with you if ever you are interested.  For now, I'll let you enjoy this long-form poem from a few years ago.*

**Theory of Everything**  
by v.stull 

Close your mouth. A body you know is re-teaching you  
to breathe. Let me sound out the alphabet  
with my own tongue. Press your palm to my chest, while  
I trace the shadows on your back. *Winter leaves us still  
wanting*.  Imagine my elbow resting  
on the piano, my eyes damp, the smell of apples  
on my neck in the dusty light.  I am humming  
that song we both know.  The one always off-key and  
awkward.  I am sketching the moon  
on the dining room table.  *A place for gathering*. When  
we were young we made patchwork mazes with  
fishhooks and rusty cans.  We navigated on crooked toes.  
We can find the door this key opens.  Our minds are weak  
enough to melt, to admit things.  *I’m as drunk as your  
father at his retirement party.  And you are petting me  
with calloused thumbs*.  
I bristle when you stroke my hair. *Stroke my hair*.  
It isn’t that the sun can’t creep between our blinds, it’s  
that we don’t recognize the light for what it is. We like  
our mysteries slightly underdone so as not  
to awake angry beasts.  The inner worlds of panic taste  
like soap.  
You are anything but pragmatic.  Give me your  
productivity for moments of reality.  In the summer you  
painted houses the color of New Mexico and sandstone.  
We made a garden  
with punctured tires.  Planted the perfect things inside:  
peppers, squash, turnips. Planted real seeds between the  
black rubber and red dirt. Water them with all your  
strength.  Is it too much to hope  
that what we plant takes root?  Are roots enough  
to outstand the wind? I go to sleep in the same bed and  
wake in the same room. *This is where I exist*.  You are a  
spackled bedframe of bone and flesh. You creak when we  
creak and sigh when we sigh.  
Let the names of the others escape from lips. Let the  
darkness saunter through mirrors in maroon strips and  
leather bandages. Your mahogany basement.  You, a  
young hearted lover, my infinite adjustment.  We are the  
questions.  We are unsteady answers.  Which is of course  
why everything we need to know is hidden in books.  
Stories of epic heroes  
and murderous battles.  A princess longs from  
her tower as the history of the world is made in  
clockwork and festering. It’s our imagination.  
Her hair the color of willow bark and gown  
an amethyst curtain. Stories we know without believing.  
Of course you grow a bonsai so small  
it can fit inside my mouth.  It is an attempt to finish  
something.  Until death or until we learn how to write our  
names in water.  Four drops for every candle.  Give it  
small leaves and tender care and ice cubes of water. This  
is the opposite of igniting.  We have not yet covered the  
horizon with trail marks nor tire treads. We have not. You  
call it the *Theory of Everything*. But I say, *We are  
disintegrating*.  Imagine the cat under the dining room  
table pressing its nose to your shin.  Imagine me in a robe  
stirring kitchen things with a long wooden spoon. You  
say, *The largest part of me is yours for the taking*. I know  
of course, the way your fingers collect splinters.  *All I  
have to give I want to give to you.*  
We laugh at the weight of all the bullshit in the world and  
how it weighs less than you mean.  You mean everything  
you say. To me, to me, with rain on slanted panes and  
windshields.  Push your back into the fireplace until the  
skin turns pink.  That is the temperature of my ideology.  
As children, again, we were popsicle days and learning to  
run.  Up mountains down canyons at the speed of youth.  
In the afternoon I will find the skeleton of an aged elk on  
the back ridge.  Feathery tendons will still be draped over  
bones, where teeth marks gnaw.  If you were here, you’d  
touch it with a stick and we would count the vertebra.  
We’d make up a story about the end. We’d follow the  
patterns of bones back down to the valley.  A body is  
only as strong as its bones. What remains are the histories  
unspoken. Remember the time  
I put my head on your shoulder and we turned pinball  
into a sex game.  We took blue chalk, drew lines down  
the centers of rooms in our houses.  
Right meant eat. Left meant sleep.  The arrows pointed to  
windows.  We were not afraid to drink  
the glass.  
Take me to the top of the world. I promise not to give  
anyone the directions.  
I promise to tell you when I lie. If every freckle were an  
island, you would be the next discovered galaxy.  
Your ocean as blue as my mother’s iris garden, your stars like  
salt droplets. We each have these histories, the ones  
we’re ashamed of. They build up like magazines in the  
corner of the closet.  *Because it used to be like this.*  
Because we loved those others with the same real hearts  
that empty our veins on every hour. We know the ending  
to the story. We are proud of the plot.  But someone  
knows the true beginning. The place where the alphabet  
was formed inside splitting cells. Use your fork and press  
it through the mandarin orange until it hits the bottom can  
ever so slightly. Yes, that sound, that pressure.  That’s all  
you need.  Peel the dry skin from your heel and place it in  
geometric shapes on the table.  Wait for your breath to  
move them. Yes, that breath. That’s all you need. We are  
sorry, too, and honestly.  
*My real-pseudo-life*.  Our mutual friends.  We’re too busy  
and tired all the time.  We’re a smashed lotus  
before and after. Picture a broken bridge with all the  
fracture wood.  And people crawling  
through streams.  We are an empty street in Rome. Just  
air. I like that no one knows me here. Anonymous inside  
a box of names.  On paper scraps and take away lids. And  
you’ll say  
*I don't want to be alone in this world*.  But I know I have  
to be.  You say the truest things, and together we fuse  
ideas and melt green glass.  We shape crystals with our  
elbows.  Sometimes I cry because it is raining and you  
are resting there on the left chest spot where we last  
spoke outside the rundown burrito shop on Main.  Crying  
because we could not figuresolve a way out. Glue is  
sometimes water soluble and beneath the tears and  
crushed leaves, we are children once more.  Remember  
the brush of my hand in sticky evening summer after  
running along the shore. We find sap in our hair after  
climbing  
the memory sour. Climb to numbness. We always curl  
like Ss on carpet.  
I’m used to this now the deepest  
feeling. I hide in between my real life and my other real  
life. I exist in the gap-space occupied by your guitar.  
This is where. Let the rain be just rain and your face the  
Nile River. Bury old letters when they start to. Hold my  
fists with your tongue. *Everything is*.  The ancients can  
still hear us breathing.
